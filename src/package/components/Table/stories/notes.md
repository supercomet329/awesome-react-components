## Table

This component is built on top of the [react-table][1] library.

## Responsiveness

The Table component is built to be mobile-friendly. The first column is sticky and the rest of the table can be scrolled horizontally for easy viewing on small screens.

_Planned improvements:_

- The columns will responsively be made smaller in width to fit better on mobile screens. [#10][2]
